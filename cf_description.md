## Enigmatica 6 Enlightened
is a modified version of Enigmatica6(E6), focusing on performence and providing same amount of content with a more 'slim' modlist. You can call it E6En.

## Fast and Slim
By removing mods whose features are already covered by other mods, the number of mods decreased by 40.   
Other than that, performance mods like Rubidium and ModernFix are added, providing much higher in-game FPS, halving bootup time, and making chunk update faster.  
The first version of E6Eu is developed based on E6 1.8.0, which contains around 353 mods. But E6Eu itself has about 324 mods.  

Note: If you want to further improve chunk performance, you can try Starlight Create. But it seems to have some issues with RoadRunner, so use it at your own risk.  

## Changes in modlist
Too many to be honest, here are some of them:  
- RS and it's extensions -> AE and it's extensions  
- Simple farming -> Neapolitan  
- CC:tweaked and it's ext -> removed  
- RSGauges -> removed  
- Atmosphere -> removed

For full list, see changelogs. 

## Longterm Plan
There are many ideas that are not yet implemented in this early version of E6En: 
- Tweak early Progession for Eidolon removal
- Remove Industral Forgegoing, and 
- add a multiblock(Digital Life Simulator), to take place of IF, also providing another way of getting Nether Star

The first version of E6En is already fully playable, so these ideas might not come true very soon.
